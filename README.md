# TwitterOlympics

I wanted to see if there was a difference between the time that Olympic athletes tweet on Twitter vs when people who follow
them on Twitter usually tweet.

I chose Michael Phelps as the athlete for this comparison. I then used a Python script to select a sample of Twitter handles from people
who followed Michael Phelps.

I graphed Phelps' tweet times and compared this to the tweet times of his followers. In order to do this, I used the hour mark from their Twitter timestamps to determine what time they were tweeting at. I discarded the minutes and marked the frequency of occurrence from 0-23 hours.
