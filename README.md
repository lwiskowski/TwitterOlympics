# TwitterOlympics

I have been watching the Olympics this summer and one of the changes that I have noticed in this Olympics is how large of an impact social media is having. I wanted to see if there was a difference between the time that Olympic athletes tweet on Twitter vs when people who follow
them on Twitter usually tweet.

I chose Michael Phelps as the athlete for this comparison. I then used a Python script to select a sample of Twitter handles from people who followed Michael Phelps.

I graphed Phelps' tweet times and compared this to the tweet times of his followers. In order to do this, I used the hour mark from their Twitter timestamps to determine what time they were tweeting at. I discarded the minutes and marked the frequency of occurrence from 0-23 hours.

My data revealed some things that I expected, as well as some that I found interesting. Michael Phelps tweets more on average than his followers. This I expected, it makes sense for a professional to tweet more than the average user. Social media is a tool for celebrities, which they can use to their advantage and keep themselves relevant to their fanbase. The part that surprised me though was the times in which user post the most. The peaks from Phelps and his followers donâ€™t line up. Phelps followers on average tweeted later than he did. I think this is because a lot of twitter users activity consists of retweeting people that they follow. Thus a lot of the posts on Twitter consist of someone famous making a tweet and their followers reacting to it.
