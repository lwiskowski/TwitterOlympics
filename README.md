# TwitterOlympics

I wanted to see if there was a difference in the time that Olympic atheletes tweet on twitter vs when people who follow 
them on Twitter usually Tweet.

I selected 3 Olympians, Michael Phelps, Ryan Lochte, and Usain Bolt. I grapped a sample of Twitter handles from people 
who followed Michael Phelps. 

I used the hour mark from their Twitter timestamps to determine what time they were tweeting at. I discarded the minutes and 
marked the frequency of occurence from 0-23
